# One Pixel Attack

A python jupiter notebook made for google colab, which will create one pixel permutations to images 
which can be used to trick image classification models for the kaggle cifar-10 dataset, uses a differential algorithm from scipi to achive this.

Instructions:
Open One_Pixel_Attacks.ipynb in google colab:  link - colab.research.google.com
Run each cell in order and some data will be stored in runtime drive, called targeted.txt and untargeted.txt, coressponding for each attack.
Running with gpu is optional but recommeneded since will be very slow on allocated cpu.
